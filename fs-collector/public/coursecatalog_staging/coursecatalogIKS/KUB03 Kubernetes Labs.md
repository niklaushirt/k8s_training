# Lab information

IBM Cloud provides the capability to run applications in containers on Kubernetes. The IBM Cloud Container Service runs Kubernetes clusters which deliver the following:

* Powerful tools
* Intuitive user experience
* Built-in security and isolation to enable rapid delivery of secure applications
* Cloud services including cognitive capabilities from Watson
* Capability to manage dedicated cluster resources for both stateless applications and stateful workloads


#  Lab overview

* Lab 0: (Optional): Provides a walkthrough for installing IBM Cloud command-line tools and the Kubernetes CLI. You can skip this lab if you have the IBM Cloud CLI, the container-service plugin, the containers-registry plugin, and the kubectl CLI already installed on your machine.

* Lab 1: This lab walks through creating and deploying a simple "guestbook" app written in Go as a net/http Server and accessing it.

* Lab 2: Builds on lab 1 to expand to a more resilient setup which can survive having containers fail and recover. Lab 2 will also walk through basic services you need to get started with Kubernetes and the IBM Cloud Container Service

* Lab 3: Builds on lab 2 by increasing the capabilities of the deployed Guestbook application. This lab covers basic distributed application design and how kubernetes helps you use standard design practices.

* Lab 4: How to enable your application so Kubernetes can automatically monitor and recover your applications with no user intervention.

* Lab D: Debugging tips and tricks to help you along your Kubernetes journey. This lab is useful reference that does not follow in a specific sequence of the other labs.

# Download the Workshop Source Code
Repo `guestbook` has the application that we'll be deploying.
While we're not going to build it we will use the deployment configuration files from that repo.
Guestbook application has two versions v1 and v2 which we will use to demonstrate some rollout
functionality later. All the configuration files we use are under the directory guestbook/v1.

Repo `kube101` contains the step by step instructions to run the workshop.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/niklaushirt/guestbook.git
$ git clone https://github.com/niklaushirt/kube101.git
```


# Configure and check your cluster 


* Run the following connamd, and set the `KUBECONFIG`
   environment variable based on the output of the command. This will
   make your `kubectl` client point to your new Kubernetes cluster. 
   
   ```
   $ ibmcloud ks cluster-config <name-of-cluster>
   
   $ export KUBECONFIG=/Users/$USER/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/mycluster/kube-config-mil01-mycluster.yml
   ```


* Verify kubectl can communicate with your cluster.

	```
   	$ kubectl cluster-info   
	
	Kubernetes master is running at https://c3.lon04.containers.cloud.ibm.com:23520
	KubeDNS is running at https://c3.lon04.containers.cloud.ibm.com:23520/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
	kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://c3.lon04.containers.cloud.ibm.com:23520/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy
	Metrics-server is running at https://c3.lon04.containers.cloud.ibm.com:23520/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:metrics-server:/proxy
   ```


* Run the following two commands to check if your cluster is ready
	
	```
	$ kubectl get nodes  
	                                                          master
	NAME            STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
	10.144.180.13   Ready    <none>   27m   v1.12.7+IKS
	
	```

## Lab 0. Get to know kubectl

Learn how to use the `kubectl` command line.

Open your terminal:

On your Mac you can hit Command + Space and type Terminal.

Type `kubectl` and you will get the list of all available commands.

```
$ kubectl

kubectl controls the Kubernetes cluster manager.

Find more information at: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/

Basic Commands (Beginner):
  create         Create a resource from a file or from stdin.
  expose         Take a replication controller, service, deployment or pod and expose it as a new Kubernetes Service
  run            Run a particular image on the cluster
  set            Set specific features on objects

Basic Commands (Intermediate):
  explain        Documentation of resources
  get            Display one or many resources
  edit           Edit a resource on the server
  delete         Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources and label selector
...

```

They allow you to work with Kubernetes objects.

The most important ones are:

* `create`        Create a resource from a file or from stdin.
* `delete`         Delete resources by filenames, stdin, resources and names, or by resources 
* `get`            Display one or many resources
* `describe`       Show details of a specific resource or group of resources


For example you can get the nodes in your cluster by typing

```kubectl get nodes```

## Lab 0. Get to know yaml

YAML ("YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications where data is being stored (e.g. debugging output) or transmitted (e.g. document headers). 

The YAML format is generally used to describe Kubernetes objects.

* Whitespace indentation is used to denote structure; however, tab characters are never allowed as indentation.
* Comments begin with the number sign (#)
* List members are denoted by a leading hyphen (-) with one member per line
* Strings are ordinarily unquoted, but may be enclosed in double-quotes ("), or single-quotes (').



__guestbook-deployment.yaml__

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: guestbook-v1
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    version: "1.0"
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: guestbook
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: guestbook
        version: "1.0"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: guestbook
        image: ibmcom/guestbook:v1
        ports:
        - name: http-server
          containerPort: 3000
```

In this example, the structure `metadata` contains `name` and `labels`. `labels` in turn contains `app` and `version`.

## Lab 1. Set up and deploy your first application

Learn how to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster hosted within
the IBM Container Service.

Once your client is configured, you are ready to deploy your first application, `guestbook`.

### 1. Deploy your application

In this part of the lab we will deploy an application called `guestbook`
that has already been built and uploaded to DockerHub under the name
`ibmcom/guestbook:v1`.


1. Start by running `guestbook`

	```
	$ kubectl run guestbook --image=ibmcom/guestbook:v1
	```

   This action will take a bit of time. To check the status of the running application,
   you can use ` kubectl get pods`.

   You should see output similar to the following:

  ```
   $ kubectl get pods
   
   NAME                          READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
   guestbook-59bd679fdc-bxdg7    0/1       ContainerCreating   0          1m
  ```
   Eventually, the status should show up as `Running`.
   
  ```
   $ kubectl get pods
   
   NAME                          READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
   guestbook-59bd679fdc-bxdg7    1/1       Running             0          1m
  ```
   
   The end result of the run command is not just the pod containing our application containers, but a Deployment resource that manages the lifecycle of those pods.
 
   
3. Once the status reads `Running`, we need to expose that deployment as a service so we can access it through the IP of the worker nodes.
   The `guestbook` application listens on port 3000.  Run:

  ```
   $ kubectl expose deployment guestbook --type="NodePort" --port=3000
   service "guestbook" exposed
  ```

4. To find the port used on that worker node, examine your new service:

  ```
   $ kubectl get service guestbook
   
   NAME        TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
   guestbook   NodePort   10.10.10.253   <none>        3000:31208/TCP   1m
  ```
   
   We can see that our `<nodeport>` is `31208`. We can see in the output the port mapping from 3000 inside 
   the pod exposed to the cluster on port 31208. This port in the 31000 range is automatically chosen, 
   and could be different for you.

5. `guestbook` is now running on your cluster, and exposed to the internet. We need to find out where it is accessible.
   The worker nodes running in the container service get external IP addresses.
   Run ` ibmcloud cs workers <name-of-cluster>`, and note the public IP listed on the `<public-IP>` line.
   
  ```
   $ ibmcloud cs workers <name-of-cluster>
   
   OK
   ID                                                 Public IP        Private IP     Machine Type   State    Status   Zone    Version  
   kube-hou02-pa1e3ee39f549640aebea69a444f51fe55-w1   173.193.99.136   10.76.194.30   free           normal   Ready    hou02   1.5.6_1500*
  ```
   
   We can see that our `<public-IP>` is `173.193.99.136`.
   
6. Now that you have both the address and the port, you can now access the application in the web browser
   at `<public-IP>:<nodeport>`. In the example case this is `173.193.99.136:31208`.
   
Congratulations, you've now deployed an application to Kubernetes!

We will be using this deployment in the next lab of this course (Lab2).

You should now go back up to the root of the repository in preparation
for the next lab: 

` cd ..`

## Lab 2: Scale and Update Deployments

In this lab, you'll learn how to update the number of instances
a deployment has and how to safely roll out an update of your application
on Kubernetes. 

For this lab, you need a running deployment of the `guestbook` application
from the previous lab. If you deleted it, recreate it using:

```
$ kubectl run guestbook --image=ibmcom/guestbook:v1
```
    
### Scale apps with replicas

A *replica* is a copy of a pod that contains a running service. By having
multiple replicas of a pod, you can ensure your deployment has the available
resources to handle increasing load on your application.

1. `kubectl` provides a `scale` subcommand to change the size of an
   existing deployment. Let's increase our capacity from a single running instance of
   `guestbook` up to 10 instances:

  ```
   $ kubectl scale --replicas=10 deployment guestbook
   deployment "guestbook" scaled
  ```

   Kubernetes will now try to make reality match the desired state of
   10 replicas by starting 9 new pods with the same configuration as
   the first.

4. To see your changes being rolled out, you can run:
   `kubectl rollout status deployment guestbook`.

   The rollout might occur so quickly that the following messages might
   _not_ display:

  ```
   $ kubectl rollout status deployment guestbook
   
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 3 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 4 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 5 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 6 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 7 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 8 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 9 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   deployment "guestbook" successfully rolled out
  ```

5. Once the rollout has finished, ensure your pods are running by using:
   `kubectl get pods`.

   You should see output listing 10 replicas of your deployment:

  ```
   $ kubectl get pods
   
   NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   guestbook-562211614-1tqm7   1/1       Running   0          1d
   guestbook-562211614-1zqn4   1/1       Running   0          2m
   guestbook-562211614-5htdz   1/1       Running   0          2m
   guestbook-562211614-6h04h   1/1       Running   0          2m
   guestbook-562211614-ds9hb   1/1       Running   0          2m
   guestbook-562211614-nb5qp   1/1       Running   0          2m
   guestbook-562211614-vtfp2   1/1       Running   0          2m
   guestbook-562211614-vz5qw   1/1       Running   0          2m
   guestbook-562211614-zksw3   1/1       Running   0          2m
   guestbook-562211614-zsp0j   1/1       Running   0          2m
  ```

**Tip:** Another way to improve availability is to 
 [add clusters and regions](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_planning.html#cs_planning_cluster_config)
to your deployment, as shown in the following diagram:

![HA with more clusters and regions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niklaushirt/kube101/master/workshop/images/cluster_ha_roadmap.png)

#### Task Kubernetes_Lab_2_Update

### Update and roll back apps

Kubernetes allows you to do rolling upgrade of your application to a new
container image. This allows you to easily update the running image and also allows you to
easily undo a rollout if a problem is discovered during or after deployment.

In the previous lab, we used an image with a `v1` tag. For our upgrade
we'll use the image with the `v2` tag.

To update and roll back:
1. Using `kubectl`, you can now update your deployment to use the
   `v2` image. `kubectl` allows you to change details about existing
   resources with the `set` subcommand. We can use it to change the
   image being used.

   ``` kubectl set image deployment/guestbook guestbook=ibmcom/guestbook:v2```

   Note that a pod could have multiple containers, each with its own name.
   Each image can be changed individually or all at once by referring to the name.
   In the case of our `guestbook` Deployment, the container name is also `guestbook`.
    Multiple containers can be updated at the same time.
   ([More information](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_set_image/).)

3. Run `kubectl rollout status deployment/guestbook` to check the status of
   the rollout. The rollout might occur so quickly that the following messages
   might _not_ display:

  ```
   $ kubectl rollout status deployment/guestbook
   
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 3 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 3 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 3 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 4 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 4 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...

   Waiting for rollout to finish: 8 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 8 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 9 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 9 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 9 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 9 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 9 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   Waiting for rollout to finish: 9 of 10 updated replicas are available...
   deployment "guestbook" successfully rolled out
  ```

4. Test the application as before, by accessing `<public-IP>:<nodeport>` 
   in the browser to confirm your new code is active.

   Remember, to get the "nodeport" and "public-ip" use:

   ` kubectl describe service guestbook`
   and
   ` ibmcloud cs workers <name-of-cluster>`

   To verify that you're running "v2" of guestbook, look at the title of the page,
   it should now be `Guestbook - v2`

5. If you want to undo your latest rollout, use:
  ```
   $ kubectl rollout undo deployment guestbook
   deployment "guestbook"
  ```

   You can then use `kubectl rollout status deployment/guestbook` to see
   the status.
   
6. When doing a rollout, you see references to *old* replicas and *new* replicas.
   The *old* replicas are the original 10 pods deployed when we scaled the application.
   The *new* replicas come from the newly created pods with the different image.
   All of these pods are owned by the Deployment.
   The deployment manages these two sets of pods with a resource called a ReplicaSet.
   We can see the guestbook ReplicaSets with:
   
  ```
   $ kubectl get replicasets -l run=guestbook
   NAME                   DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
   guestbook-5f5548d4f    10        10        10        21m
   guestbook-768cc55c78   0         0         0         3h
  ```

Before we continue, let's delete the application so we can learn about
a different way to achieve the same results:

 To remove the deployment, use `kubectl delete deployment guestbook`.

 To remove the service, use `kubectl delete service guestbook`.

Congratulations! You deployed the second version of the app. 
Lab 2 is now complete.

## Lab 3: Scale and update apps natively, building multi-tier applications.

In this lab you'll learn how to deploy the same guestbook application we
deployed in the previous labs, however, instead of using the `kubectl`
command line helper functions we'll be deploying the application using
configuration files. The configuration file mechanism allows you to have more
fine-grained control over all of resources being created within the
Kubernetes cluster.

Before we work with the application we need to clone a github repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/guestbook.git
```

This repo contains multiple versions of the guestbook application
as well as the configuration files we'll use to deploy the pieces of the application.

Change directory by running the command `cd guestbook`. You will find all the
configurations files for this exercise under the directory `v1`.

### Scale apps natively

Kubernetes can deploy an individual pod to run an application but when you
need to scale it to handle a large number of requests a `Deployment` is the
resource you want to use.
A Deployment manages a collection of similar pods. When you ask for a specific number of replicas
the Kubernetes Deployment Controller will attempt to maintain that number of replicas at all times.

Every Kubernetes object we create should provide two nested object fields
that govern the object’s configuration: the object `spec` and the object
`status`. Object `spec` defines the desired state, and object `status`
contains Kubernetes system provided information about the actual state of the
resource. As described before, Kubernetes will attempt to reconcile
your desired state with the actual state of the system.

For Object that we create we need to provide the `apiVersion` you are using
to create the object, `kind` of the object we are creating and the `metadata`
about the object such as a `name`, set of `labels` and optionally `namespace`
that this object should belong.

Consider the following deployment configuration for guestbook application

**guestbook-deployment.yaml**

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: guestbook
  labels:
    app: guestbook
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: guestbook
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: guestbook
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: guestbook
        image: ibmcom/guestbook:v1
        ports:
        - name: http-server
          containerPort: 3000
```

The above configuration file create a deployment object named 'guestbook'
with a pod containing a single container running the image
`ibmcom/guestbook:v1`.  Also the configuration specifies replicas set to 3
and Kubernetes tries to make sure that at least three active pods are running at
all times.

- Create guestbook deployment

   To create a Deployment using this configuration file we use the
   following command:

  ```
   $ cd guestbook/v1/
   $ kubectl create -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
   deployment "guestbook" created
  ```

- List the pod with label app=guestbook

  We can then list the pods it created by listing all pods that
  have a label of "app" with a value of "guestbook". This matches
  the labels defined above in the yaml file in the
  `spec.template.metadata.labels` section.

  ``` 
   $ kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook
  ```
 

When you change the number of replicas in the configuration, Kubernetes will
try to add, or remove, pods from the system to match your request. 



Open the deployment file we used to create the Deployment in your preferred editor to make changes. 
You'll notice that there are a lot more fields in this version than the original yaml
file we used. This is because it contains all of the properties about the
Deployment that Kubernetes knows about, not just the ones we chose to
specify when we create it. 

You should use the following command to make the change effective when you have finished editing the yaml file.

  ```
   $ kubectl apply -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
  ```

This will ask Kubernetes to "diff" our yaml file with the current state
of the Deployment and apply just those changes.

We can now define a Service object to expose the deployment to external
clients.

**guestbook-service.yaml**

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: guestbook
  labels:
    app: guestbook
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
    targetPort: http-server
  selector:
    app: guestbook
  type: LoadBalancer
```

The above configuration creates a Service resource named guestbook. A Service
can be used to create a network path for incoming traffic to your running
application.  In this case, we are setting up a route from port 3000 on the
cluster to the "http-server" port on our app, which is port 3000 per the
Deployment container spec.

- Let us now create the guestbook service using the same type of command
  we used when we created the Deployment:

   ```
   $ kubectl create -f guestbook-service.yaml 
   ```

### Connect to a back-end service

If you look at the guestbook source code, under the `guestbook/v1/guestbook`
directory, you'll notice that it is written to support a variety of data
stores. By default it will keep the log of guestbook entries in memory.
That's ok for testing purposes, but as you get into a more "real" environment
where you scale your application that model will not work because
based on which instance of the application the user is routed to they'll see
very different results.

To solve this we need to have all instances of our app share the same data
store - in this case we're going to use a redis database that we deploy to our
cluster. This instance of redis will be defined in a similar manner to the guestbook.

### Deploy Redis Master 

**redis-master-deployment.yaml**

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-master
  labels:
    app: redis
    role: master
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
      role: master
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
        role: master
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis-master
        image: redis:2.8.23
        ports:
        - name: redis-server
          containerPort: 6379
```

This yaml creates a redis database in a Deployment named 'redis-master'.
It will create a single instance, with replicas set to 1, and the guestbook app instances
will connect to it to persist data, as well as read the persisted data back.
The image running in the container is 'redis:2.8.23' and exposes the standard redis port 6379.

- Create a redis Deployment, like we did for guestbook:

   ```
    $ kubectl create -f redis-master-deployment.yaml
   ```

- Check to see that redis server pod is running:

   ```
    $ kubectl get pods -l app=redis,role=master
    NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    redis-master-q9zg7   1/1       Running   0          2d
   ```

- Let us test the redis standalone:

    ` $ kubectl exec -it redis-master-q9zg7 redis-cli `

    The kubectl exec command will start a secondary process in the specified
    container. In this case we're asking for the "redis-cli" command to be
    executed in the container named "redis-master-q9zg7".  When this process
    ends the "kubectl exec" command will also exit but the other processes in
    the container will not be impacted.

    Once in the container we can use the "redis-cli" command to make sure the
    redis database is running properly, or to configure it if needed.

   ```
    redis-cli> ping
    PONG
    redis-cli> exit
   ```

### Expose Redis Master 

Now we need to expose the `redis-master` Deployment as a Service so that the
guestbook application can connect to it through DNS lookup. 

**redis-master-service.yaml**

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-master
  labels:
    app: redis
    role: master
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 6379
    targetPort: redis-server
  selector:
    app: redis
    role: master
```

This creates a Service object named 'redis-master' and configures it to target
port 6379 on the pods selected by the selectors "app=redis" and "role=master".

- Create the service to access redis master:

   ``` $ kubectl create -f redis-master-service.yaml```

- Restart guestbook so that it will find the redis service to use database:

   ```
    $ kubectl delete deploy guestbook-v1
    $ kubectl create -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
   ```

- Test guestbook app using a browser of your choice using the url:
  `<your-cluster-ip>:<node-port>`
  
You can see now that if you open up multiple browsers and refresh the page
to access the different copies of guestbook that they all have a consistent state.
All instances write to the same backing persistent storage, and all instances
read from that storage to display the guestbook entries that have been stored.

We have our simple 3-tier application running but we need to scale the
application if traffic increases. Our main bottleneck is that we only have
one database server to process each request coming though guestbook. One
simple solution is to separate the reads and write such that they go to
different databases that are replicated properly to achieve data consistency.

### Deploy Redis Slave 

Create a deployment named 'redis-slave' that can talk to redis database to
manage data reads. In order to scale the database we use the pattern where
we can scale the reads using redis slave deployment which can run several
instances to read. Redis slave deployments is configured to run two replicas.

![w_to_master-r_to_slave](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niklaushirt/kube101/master/workshop/images/Master-Slave.png)

**redis-slave-deployment.yaml**

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-slave
  labels:
    app: redis
    role: slave
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
      role: slave
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
        role: slave
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis-slave
        image: kubernetes/redis-slave:v2
        ports:
        - name: redis-server
          containerPort: 6379
```

- Create the pod  running redis slave deployment.
``` $ kubectl create -f redis-slave-deployment.yaml```

 - Check if all the slave replicas are running
 
```
$ kubectl get pods -l app=redis,role=slave
NAME                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-slave-kd7vx   1/1       Running   0          2d
redis-slave-wwcxw   1/1       Running   0          2d
```

- And then go into one of those pods and look at the database to see
  that everything looks right:

```
$ kubectl exec -it redis-slave-kd7vx  redis-cli

127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "guestbook"
127.0.0.1:6379> lrange guestbook 0 10
1) "hello world"
2) "welcome to the Kube workshop"
127.0.0.1:6379> exit

```

### Expose Redis Slave 

Deploy redis slave service so we can access it by DNS name. Once redeployed,
the application will send "read" operations to the `redis-slave` pods while
"write" operations will go to the `redis-master` pods.


**redis-slave-service.yaml**

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-slave
  labels:
    app: redis
    role: slave
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 6379
    targetPort: redis-server
  selector:
    app: redis
    role: slave
```

- Create the service to access redis slaves.
   ``` $ kubectl create -f redis-slave-service.yaml```

- Restart guestbook so that it will find the slave service to read from.
   ```
    $ kubectl delete deploy guestbook-v1
    $ kubectl create -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
   ```
    
- Test guestbook app using a browser of your choice using the url `<your-cluster-ip>:<node-port>`.

That's the end of the lab. Now let's clean-up our environment:

```
$ kubectl delete -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f guestbook-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f redis-slave-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f redis-slave-deployment.yaml 
kubectl delete -f redis-master-service.yaml 
kubectl delete -f redis-master-deployment.yaml
```
