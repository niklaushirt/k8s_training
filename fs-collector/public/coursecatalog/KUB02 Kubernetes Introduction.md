:infotab: <h1 id="toc_0">Tips and Tricks for getting around in the labs</h1>
:infotab: <p>Advanced debugging techniques to reach your pods.</p>
:infotab: <h2 id="toc_1">Pod Logs</h2>
:infotab: <p>You can look at the logs of any of the pods running under your deployments as follows</p>
:infotab: <div><pre><code class="language-console">$ kubectl logs &lt;podname&gt;</code></pre></div>
:infotab: <p>Remember that if you have multiple containers running in your pod, you have to specify the specific container you want to see logs from.</p>
:infotab: <div><pre><code class="language-console">$ kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt; &lt;container-name&gt;</code></pre></div>
:infotab: <p>This subcommand operates like <code>tail</code>. Including the <code>-f</code> flag will
:infotab: continue to stream the logs live once the current time is reached.</p>
:infotab: <h2 id="toc_2">kubectl edit and vi</h2>
:infotab: <p>By default, on many Linux and macOS systems, you will be dropped into the editor <code>vi</code>.
:infotab: If you end up in vi you can quit by typing <code>ESC :q!</code></p>
:infotab: <p>IF you prefer using nano as an editor, execute </p>
:infotab: <div><pre><code class="language-none">export EDITOR=nano</code></pre></div>
:infotab: <p>On Windows, a copy of <code>notepad.exe</code> will be opened with the contents of the file.</p>
:infotab: <h2 id="toc_3">nano basic commands</h2>
:infotab: <div><pre><code class="language-none">Ctrl-O      To save your work (WriteOut)
:infotab: <BR>Ctrl-X      To exit nano
:infotab: <BR>Ctrl-W      To search for text in a document
:infotab: <BR>Ctrl-K      To cut a line of text</code></pre></div>
:infotab: <h2 id="toc_4">busybox pod</h2>
:infotab: <p>For debugging live, this command frequently helps me:</p>
:infotab: <div><pre><code class="language-console">kubectl run bb --image busybox --restart=Never -it --rm</code></pre></div>
:infotab: <p>In the busybox image is a basic shell that contains useful utilities.</p>
:infotab: <p>Utils I often use are <code>nslookup</code> and <code>wget</code>. </p>
:infotab: <p><code>nslookup</code> is useful for testing DNS resolution in a pod.</p>
:infotab: <p><code>wget</code> is useful for trying to do network requests.</p>
:infotab: <h2 id="toc_5">Service Endpoints</h2>
:infotab: <p>Endpoint resource can be used to see all the service endpoints.</p>
:infotab: <div><pre><code class="language-console">$ kubectl get endpoints &lt;service&gt;</code></pre></div>
:infotab: <h2 id="toc_6">ImagePullPolicy</h2>
:infotab: <p>By default Kubernetes will only pull the image on first use. This can be confusing during development when you expect changes to show up.</p>
:infotab: <p>You should be aware of the three <code>ImagePullPolicy</code>:</p>
:infotab: <ul>
:infotab: <li>IfNotPresent - the default, only request the image if not present.</li>

### An introduction to containers

Docker is an open source project that was released by dotCloud in 2013. Built on features of the existing Linux container technology (LXC), Docker became a software platform that you can use to build, test, deploy, and scale apps quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units that are called containers that include all of the elements that an app needs to run.




Containers allow you to run securely isolated applications with quotas on system resources. Containers started out as an individual feature delivered with the linux kernel. Docker launched with making containers easy to use and developers quickly latched onto that idea. Containers have also sparked an interest in microservice architecture, a design pattern for developing applications in which complex applications are down into smaller, composable pieces which work together.

__Optional__ Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlBhtc31I8c) to learn about production uses of containers.

__Optional__ HYou might want to check out our [Docker Essentials](https://developer.ibm.com/courses/all/docker-essentials-extend-your-apps-with-containers/).

### Virtual machines

Prior to containers, most infrastructure ran not on bare metal, but atop hypervisors managing multiple virtualized operating systems (OSes). This arrangement allowed isolation of applications from one another on a higher level than that provided by the OS. These virtualized operating systems see what looks like their own exclusive hardware. However, this also means that each of these virtual operating systems are replicating an entire OS, taking up disk space.

---


### Containers

Containers provide isolation similar to VMs, except provided by the OS and at the process level. Each container is a process or group of processes run in isolation. Typical containers explicitly run only a single process, as they have no need for the standard system services. What they usually need to do can be provided by system calls to the base OS kernel.

The isolation on linux is provided by a feature called 'namespaces'. Each different kind of isolation (IE user, cgroups) is provided by a different namespace.

This is a list of some of the namespaces that are commonly used and visible to the user:

* PID - process IDs
* USER - user and group IDs
* UTS - hostname and domain name
* NS - mount points
* NET - network devices, stacks, and ports
* CGROUPS - control limits and monitoring of resources

---


### VM vs container

Traditional applications are run on native hardware. A single application does not typically use the full resources of a single machine. We try to run multiple applications on a single machine to avoid wasting resources. We could run multiple copies of the same application, but to provide isolation we use VMs to run multiple application instances (VMs) on the same hardware. These VMs have full operating system stacks which make them relatively large and inefficient due to duplication both at runtime and on disk.

![Containers versus VMs](./images/VMvsContainer.png)

Containers allow you to share the host OS. This reduces duplication while still providing the isolation. Containers also allow you to drop unneeded files such as system libraries and binaries to save space and reduce your attack surface. If SSHD or LIBC are not installed, they cannot be exploited.

## Docker Terminoloy


Review these concepts to learn about basic Docker concepts.

**Container**

A container is a standard way to package an app and all its dependencies so that the app can be moved between environments and run without changes. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not virtualize a device, its operating system, and the underlying hardware. Only the app code, run time, system tools, libraries, and settings are packaged inside the container. Containers run as isolated processes on the compute host where they are deployed to and share the host operating system and its hardware resources. This approach makes a container more lightweight, portable, and efficient than a virtual machine.

**Image**

Every container is based on a Docker image and is considered to be an instance of an image. An image is built from a Dockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions how to build the image, and any build artifacts, such as an app, the app's configuration, and its dependencies.

**Registry**

An image registry is a place where you store, retrieve, and share Docker images. Images that are stored in a registry can either be publicly available (public registry) or accessible by a small group of users only (private registry). IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service offers public images, such as ibmliberty that you can use to get started with Docker and Kubernetes to create your first containerized app in a cluster. When it comes to enterprise applications, use a private registry like the one provided in IBM Cloud to protect your images from being used and changed by unauthorized users. 

When you want to deploy a container from an image, you must make sure that the image is stored in either a public or private image registry.

# Kubernetes and containers: an overview

Let's talk about Kubernetes orchestration for containers before we build an application on it. We need to understand the following facts about it:

* What is Kubernetes, exactly?
* How was Kubernetes created?
* Kubernetes architecture
* Kubernetes resource model
* Kubernetes at IBM
* Let's get started

# What is Kubernetes?

Now that we know what containers are, let's define what Kubernetes is. Kubernetes is a container orchestrator to provision, manage, and scale applications. In other words, Kubernetes allows you to manage the lifecycle of containerized applications within a cluster of nodes (which are a collection of worker machines, for example, VMs, physical machines etc.).

Your applications may need many other resources to run such as Volumes, Networks,  and Secrets that will help you to do things such as connect to databases, talk to firewalled backends, and secure keys. Kubernetes helps you add these resources into your application. Infrastructure resources needed by applications are managed declaratively.

**Fast fact:** Other orchestration technologies are Mesos and Swarm.  

The key paradigm of kubernetes is itâ€™s Declarative model. The user provides the "desired state" and Kubernetes will do it's best make it happen. If you need 5 instances, you do not start 5 separate instances on your own but rather tell Kubernetes that you need 5 instances and Kubernetes will reconcile the state automatically. Simply at this point you need to know that you declare the state you want and Kubernetes makes that happen. If something goes wrong with one of your instances and it crashes, Kubernetes still knows the desired state and creates a new instances on an available node.

**Fun to know:** Kubernetes goes by many names. Sometimes it is shortened to _k8s_ (losing the internal 8 letters), or _kube_. The word is rooted in ancient Greek and means "Helmsman". A helmsman is the person who steers a ship. We hope you can seen the analogy between directing a ship and the decisions made to orchestrate containers on a cluster.

# How was Kubernetes created?

Google wanted to open source their knowledge of creating and running the internal tools Borg & Omega. It adopted Open Governance for Kubernetes by starting the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and giving Kubernetes to that foundation, therefore making it less influenced by Google directly. Many companies such as RedHat, Microsoft, IBM and Amazon quickly joined the foundation.

Main entry point for the kubernetes project is at [http://kubernetes.io](http://kubernetes.io) and the source code can be found at [https://github.com/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes).

# Kubernetes architecture

At its core, Kubernetes is a data store (etcd). The declarative model is stored in the data store as objects, that means when you say I want 5 instances of a container then that request is stored into the data store. This information change is watched and delegated to Controllers to take action. Controllers then react to the model and attempt to take action to achieve the desired state. The power of Kubernetes is in its simplistic model.

As shown, API server is a simple HTTP server handling create/read/update/delete(CRUD) operations on the data store. Then the controller picks up the change you wanted and makes that happen. Controllers are responsible for instantiating the actual resource represented by any Kubernetes resource. These actual resources are what your application needs to allow it to run successfully.

# Kubernetes resource model

Kubernetes Infrastructure defines a resource for every purpose. Each resource is monitored and processed by a controller. When you define your application, it contains a collection of these resources. This collection will then be read by Controllers to build your applications actual backing instances. Some of resources that you may work with are listed below for your reference, for a full list you should go to [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/). In this class we will only use a few of them, like Pod, Deployment, etc.

* Config Maps holds configuration data for pods to consume.
* Daemon Sets ensure that each node in the cluster runs this Pod
* Deployments defines a desired state of a deployment object
* Events provides lifecycle events on Pods and other deployment objects
* Endpoints allows a inbound connections to reach the cluster services
* Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the cluster services
* Jobs creates one or more pods and as they complete successfully the job is marked as completed.
* Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes
* Namespaces are multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster
* Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes
* Persistent Volumes provides an API for users and administrators that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed
* Replica Sets ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time
* Secrets are intended to hold sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys
* Service Accounts provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod
* Services  is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them - sometimes called a micro-service.
* Stateful Sets is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications.   
* and more...


![Relationship of pods, nodes, and containers](./images/container-pod-node-master-relationship.jpg)

Kubernetes does not have the concept of an application. It has simple building blocks that you are required to compose. Kubernetes is a cloud native platform where the internal resource model is the same as the end user resource model.

# Key resources

A Pod is the smallest object model that you can create and run. You can add labels to a pod to identify a subset to run operations on. When you are ready to scale your application you can use the label to tell Kubernetes which Pod you need to scale. A Pod typically represent a process in your cluster. Pods contain at least one container that runs the job and additionally may have other containers in it called sidecars for monitoring, logging, etc. Essentially a Pod is a group of containers.

When we talk about a application, we usually refer to group of Pods. Although an entire application can be run in a single Pod, we usually build multiple Pods that talk to each other to make a useful application. We will see why separating the application logic and backend database into separate Pods will scale better when we build an application shortly.

Services define how to expose your app as a DNS entry to have a stable reference. We use query based selector to choose which pods are supplying that service.

The user directly manipulates resources via yaml:
`$ kubectl (create|get|apply|delete) -f myResource.yaml`

Kubernetes provides us with a client interface through â€˜kubectlâ€™. Kubectl commands allow you to manage your applications, manage cluster and cluster resources, by modifying the model in the data store.


## Kubernetes

Kubernetes was developed by Google as part of the Borg project and handed off to the open source community in 2015. Kubernetes combines more than 15 years of Google research in running a containerized infrastructure with production work loads, open source contributions, and Docker container management tools to provide an isolated and secure app platform that is portable, extensible, and self-healing in case of failovers.

Learn about the basics of how Kubernetes works with a little terminology.

**Cluster**

A Kubernetes cluster consists of one or more virtual machines that are called worker nodes. Every worker node represents a compute host where you can deploy, run, and manage containerized apps. Worker nodes are managed by a Kubernetes master that centrally controls and monitors all Kubernetes resources in the cluster. When you deploy a containerized app, the Kubernetes master decides where to deploy the app, taking into account the deployment requirements and available capacity in the cluster.

**Pod**

Every containerized app that is deployed into a Kubernetes cluster is deployed, run, and managed by a pod. Pods represent the smallest deployable units in a Kubernetes cluster and are used to group containers that must be treated as a single unit. In most cases, a container is deployed to its own pod. However, an app might require a container and other helper containers to be deployed into one pod so that those containers can be addressed by using the same private IP address.

**Deployment**

A deployment is a Kubernetes resource where you specify your containers and other Kubernetes resources that are required to run your app, such as persistent storage, services, or annotations. Deployments are documented in a Kubernetes deployment script. When you run a deployment, the Kubernetes master deploys the specified containers into pods taking into account the capacity that is available on the worker nodes of the cluster. Other Kubernetes resources are created and configured as specified in the deployment script. 

You can use a deployment to define update strategies for your app, which includes the number of pods that you want to add during a rolling update and the number of pods that can be unavailable at a time. When you perform a rolling update, the deployment checks whether the revision is working and stops the rollout when failures are detected.

**Service**

A Kubernetes service groups a set of pods and provides network connection to these pods for other services in the cluster without exposing the actual private IP address of each pod. You can use a service to make your app available within your cluster or to the public internet.

# Kubernetes application deployment workflow

![deployment workflow](./images/app_deploy_workflow.png)

1. User via ```kubectl``` deploys a new application. Kubectl sends the request to the API Server.
2. API server receives the request and stores it in the data store (etcd). Once the request is written to data store, the API server is done with the request.
3. Watchers detects the resource changes and send a notification to controller to act upon it
4. Controller detects the new app and creates new pods to match the desired number# of instances. Any changes to the stored model will be picked up to create or delete Pods.
5. Scheduler assigns new pods to a Node based on a criteria. Scheduler makes decisions to run Pods on specific Nodes in the cluster. Scheduler modifies the model with the node information.
6. Kubelet on a node detects a pod with an assignment to itself, and deploys the requested containers via the container runtime (e.g. Docker). Each Node watches the storage to see what pods it is assigned to run. It takes necessary actions on resource assigned to it like create/delete Pods.
7. Kubeproxy manages network traffic for the pods â€“ including service discovery and load-balancing. Kubeproxy is responsible for communication between Pods that want to interact.
